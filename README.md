# reddit-bot

The purpose of this bot is to add the top 50 users of r/all as approved users to a private subreddit.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create `.env` file with credentials
4. Run `node app` to serve.

## Notes

1. It is important to note that the Reddit account you create have permissions to execute the actions needed.
2. This bot is not set up to use OAuth tokens.  Maybe I will do that later, or feel free to give me a pull request to approve ;)
